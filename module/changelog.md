🚀 **TEESimulator v2.1 Hotfix Release is Live!** 🚀

This urgent hotfix addresses several critical issues identified in the previous v2.0 release.

The v2.0 update, a significant refactoring effort, unfortunately introduced a few unexpected behaviors and bugs that we are now rectifying.

**Key fixes in this release include:**
1.  **Google Play Integrity:** Resolved an issue preventing the attainment of STRONG integrity for Google Play verdicts, caused by an incorrect vendor patch level format. ✅
2.  **Application Stability:** Fixed a critical crash related to an incorrect signature for the `SystemProperties.set` stub method. 🐛
3.  **Stealth Enhancement:** Implemented a fix to bypass detection by the `Android Native Detector`. 👻

🔬 We are actively investigating a recent detection method to further enhance stealth capabilities.

🙏 Support for TEE-broken devices and Android 10/11 remains an area of ongoing improvement. We highly encourage you to submit any issues you encounter to help us refine these aspects! 🤝
